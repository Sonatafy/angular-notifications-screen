Task: Notifications Flow
    Build a simple app with two screens.

    Screen 1 – Main Screen
        Show a big button labeled “Notifications”.

    When the user taps the button, open the Notification Center screen.

    Screen 2 – Notification Center
        Show a title: “Notification Center”.
        Show a small text link on the right: “Clear all”.
        Show a vertical list of notifications.

    Each notification has:
        An icon on the left.
        A title (e.g. New Message).
        A short description line.
        A trash can icon on the right.

    Expected behavior
        Tapping the trash can removes only that notification from the list.
        Tapping “Clear all” removes all notifications.

    When there are no notifications:
        Show a message like: “You have no notifications.”
        “Clear all” should not be active.

    The user can go back from the Notification Center to the main screen.
